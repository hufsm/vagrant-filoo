    warn_insecure_ssh: |-
        Warning! By not specifying a custom public/private keypair,
        Vagrant is defaulting to use the insecure keypair that ships with
        Vagrant. While this isn't much of a big deal for local development,
        this is quite insecure for remote servers. Please specify a custom
        public/private keypair.
    warn_insecure_winrm: |-
        Warning! Vagrant is using plaintext communication for WinRM. While
        this isn't much of a big deal for local development, this is quite
        insecure for remote servers. Please configure WinRM to use SSL.
    warn_networks: |-
        Warning! The Rackspace provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
        high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
        will be silently ignored.
    warn_winrm_password: |-
        Warning! Vagrant has no way to store the Administrator password generated
        by Rackspace for later use with WinRM. Please configure Vagrant to use
        the same value for the winrm password and the Rackspace admin_password so
        Vagrant will be able to connect via WinRM.
    will_not_destroy: "The server will not be deleted."
